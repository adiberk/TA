# TA OnDemand 
##### *created by: Nick April, Horace Wang, Adi Berkowitz*

##### Introduction:

Most higher education institutions incorporate some form of Teaching Assistants (TAs) into their classes. TAs are typically undergraduate or graduate students who help students learn the course material by providing in-person or online assistance, usually called office hours. The office hour schedule is usually scheduled at the beginning of the semester and is available to students as a pdf online. This system works, and it is simple. But it is not terribly efficient, as such intimate help does not scale very well. We estimate that around 15% of students will seek help from a TA at a given time. With large classes, office hour demand quite often exceeds its capacity. The result for students is not only long wait times but also frustration for those who have short but crucial questions. 

And so, TA OnDemand addresses these problems by standardizing office hours, allowing students to find all the information about the TA help available to them for all their classes in one location. Our overarching goals were efficiency and convenience. We hypothesized that, with the right application, TAâ€™s could field questions from more students at once. And furthermore, that by making it easier to meet up, we could connect students seeking help, with the TAs offering to do so. Ultimately, we hope this app will encourage interaction among TAs and students and therefore improve the quality of student learning.

##### Overview of Features:

TA OnDemand accomplishes these goals by automating the relationship between students and TAs in three different ways.

1. Dynamic scheduler
2. Appointments
3. Live chat

The dynamic scheduler appears on each course page, as well as the user page and allows students to easily view the weekly office hour schedules for their classes. The average peer rating for each TA is also included. With this scheduler, students can find a reputable TA available for help in just a quick glance. This scheduler also addresses office hour challenges from a TA perspective. Creating an office hour schedule for large classes is a difficult task as you will need to consider both student and TA availability. With this scheduler, each TA can create their own office hour schedule by signing up for a given time slots. These can easily be changed if the TA ever needs to cancel or change a particular office hour. 

For those who are unavailable during the normal office hour schedule, there is an appointment request feature built into the scheduler. A student can click on any cell not occupied by an office hour and request to meet with a TA at that time. The TA will be notified and can then decide to approve or deny the request. Both the student and the TA can view the status of appointment requests on their own profile page.

For immediate help, students and TAs are able to connect through live chat. This feature allows students to chat instantly with any of the TAs for their classes. With live chat, a TA can completely virtualize his/her office hour by fielding questions online. This could be used on days with inclement weather or be apart of the regular office hour schedule.

TA ratings supplement these three main features by giving TAs an incentive to teach well and allowing students to find well rated TAs. Each TA has a TA Profile page which shows their average rating and all the comments given by any of their students. This allows TAs to build a reputation, making them more likely to be hired by professors and can go on their resume.


##### Brief Overview:
TA OnDemand is a Ruby on Rails application designed to improve the relationship of Teaching Assistants to students in large University classes. 


Some key features are:
* Complex schema
* A dynamic scheduler to show Teaching Assistant Office Hours
* Appointment Requests
* Teach Assistant ratings and reviews
* Live Chat
